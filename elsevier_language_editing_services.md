Elsevier Language Editing Services (https://webshop.elsevier.com/language-editing/)

Elsevier offers a language editing service that allows researchers to focus on their work and worry less about scientific communication. As expected of their editing services, the logic, structure, and content of the paper will be reviewed, as well as the references checked for consistency, completeness, and structure. A significant time-saver is the manuscript formatting according to journal requirements which could be worthwhile.
